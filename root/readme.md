### Getting Started

Lessons are written in Markdown inside the `lessons` directory. To add a lesson, make a copy of an existing lesson, update the front matter, and add your Markdown content below.

### Deploying

- If you just want to compile the production build, run `roots compile -e production` and it will build to public.
- To deploy your site with a single command, run `make ship`
- We only have one environment for this project since it's internal.

### To Do

- Set up a production site on bycarrot.is with DNSimple and update this readme.
